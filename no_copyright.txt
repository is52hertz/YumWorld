YumWorld:
YumWorld is an offshoot of YumLife and Skps2010/OneLife.
YumLife is an offshoot of the Hetuw mod, which has the same protocol as the hetuw mod.
skps2010 and all of the above are branches of OneHourOneLife.
OneHourOneLife is the original version of the game.

I put it in the public domain and you can mod YumWorld any way you want.
However, you need to state within the game you're modifying that it's modified from YumWorld, and that the original version of the game is OneLife, with a clear link pointing to them.
