# What's this?

YumLife is a fork of [hetuw](https://github.com/hetuw/OneLife). The primary
goal is to keep hetuw's excellent feature set while staying up to date with the
latest changes to the vanilla OHOL client. Some additional bugfixes and "must
have" features from other mods will also be added over time.

# Installing (and updating)

## Steam users:

1. Make sure the game is fully updated in Steam.
2. Run the game from Steam once to ensure the Steam login details are properly set up.
3. Download the latest version of the mod from [the Releases page](https://github.com/selb/YumLife/releases). For Windows, this is YumLife_windows.exe.
4. Install the mod into the OHOL installation folder (Steam users: right click game > Manage > Browse local files)
5. Run the mod from the OHOL installation folder.

## Direct download users:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the game. The URL to re-download is: `http://onehouronelife.com/ticketServer/server.php?action=show_downloads&ticket_id=YOURKEYHERE`
2. Run the vanilla `OneLife.exe` once to download any necessary updates.
3. Install the mod into the OHOL installation folder (same folder as the vanilla `OneLife.exe`).
4. Run the mod from the OHOL installation folder.

# Usage

Press `H` in-game to see everything the mod can do. A `hetuw.cfg` file is
generated in the OHOL install folder and can be tweaked to your liking.

# Troubleshooting

## Make sure the base game is updated

If using Steam, launch Steam and make sure there isn't a pending update on the
base game.

If not using Steam, make sure to download the latest package and then run the
vanilla client once to fetch updates. You can download from: `http://onehouronelife.com/ticketServer/server.php?action=show_downloads&ticket_id=YOURKEYHERE`

## Clear cache files

Search the OHOL installation folder (Steam users: right click game > Manage >
Browse local files) for any `.fcz` files and delete all of them. They will be
regenerated automatically the next time you launch the game.

## Reinstall

The usual hacks used to keep outdated hetuw (and other mods) running can
interfere with updates and leave your game directory in a state that isn't
readily salvageable. Uninstalling, reinstalling, and then following the
"Installation" section again carefully is the closest thing available to a 100%
certain fix.

## Still not working?

Open a bug report using the Issues tab above, or ping me (@selb) on the OHOL
Discord.

# Compiling

See the original [hetuw](https://github.com/hetuw/OneLife) mod's instructions
for the most straightforward approach. If you already compile other mods or
the base game, you can ignore the hetuw build scripts and build however you
prefer.
